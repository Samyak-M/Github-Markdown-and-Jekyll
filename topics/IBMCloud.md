# Jekyll
Jekyll is a static site generator. Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder, it is distributed under the open source MIT license.

## Feature
Jekyll renders Markdown or Textile and Liquid templates, and produces a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache HTTP Server, Nginx or another web server. As Jekyll is a static site generator, it does not use databases to generate the pages dynamically. Instead of using databases, Jekyll supports loading content from YAML, JSON, CSV, and TSV files. Content inside the data files (YAML, JSON, CSV and TSV files) can be accessed via Liquid templating system. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, a GitHub feature that allows users to host websites based on their GitHub repositories for no additional cost.

Jekyll can be used in combination with front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap, Semantic UI and many others.

Jekyll sites can be connected to cloud-based CMS software such as CloudCannon, Forestry, Netlify or Siteleaf, enabling content editors to modify site content without having to know how to code.
