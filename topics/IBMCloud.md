# Step 5: Manage your invoices and payment methods

Before you start working with resources in your account, familiarize yourself with where you can manage your payment method and access your invoices.

## Managing your payment method

*   To manage your payment method for an account that's billed in USD currency, go to **Manage > Billing and usage**, and select **Payments**.
*   To manage your payment method for an account that's billed in non-USD currency, go to [**IBM Billing**](https://login.ibm.com/authsvc/mtfim/sps/authsvc?PolicyId=urn:ibm:security:authentication:asf:basicldapuser&Target=https%3A%2F%2Flogin.ibm.com%2Foidc%2Fendpoint%2Fdefault%2Fauthorize%3FqsId%3Da0df1a36-75c8-410b-a254-f812c6a437a0%26client_id%3DMyIBMDallasProdCI).

## Accessing your invoices

- To access an invoice for an account that's billed in USD currency, go to **Manage > Billing** and usage, and select **Invoices**.
- To access an invoice for an account that's billed in non-USD currency, go to **Manage > Billing** and usage, and select **Invoices**. Then, click **IBM Invoices**.

# Step 7: Create your resource groups

Resource groups provide a way for you to easily manage access to multiple resources and to view billing usage for a set of resources. With your Pay-As-You-Go account, you can create more resource groups in addition to the default resource group that's included when you first created your Lite account.

1. Go to **Manage > Account > Account resources > Resource groups**.
1. Click **Create**.
1. Enter a name for your resource group, and click **Add**.
